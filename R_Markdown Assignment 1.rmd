```{r , echo = FALSE}
#downloaded tidyverse, knitr, and bslib from Tools menu
```

```{r , include = FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
gun_deaths <- read.csv(url)
```

```{r , include = FALSE}

library(bslib)
youth <- filter(gun_deaths, age <= 65)
```

```{r , include = FALSE}
summary(youth)
```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. 
Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65.
The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age))+
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)
```

```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race)%>%fct_rev()))+
  geom_bar()+coord_flip()+
  labs(x="Victim race")
```
